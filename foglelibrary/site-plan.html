      <p>
        The love of reading has really defined me as a person and as a parent. When I look back at my younger years and think what impacted me the most it was that I loved to read and I read all the time. As an adult I have now climbed the literature ladder to the point where I want to only read and own books that uplift and inspire me to be a better person. I want to feel good about the time I spend reading.
        <br>
        <br>
        The authors included on this page are some of the men and women who have made me a better person through reading their works. The stories included inspire by reminding us what it means to be a person of good moral and character, what it means to be a hard worker and not give up, and to think of others before yourself.

      <h3>Brandon Sanderson</h3>
      <p>
        The main series that Brandon Sanderson has produced is called the Strom Light Archive. It is a masterpiece of imagination and world building. The characters in it have problems like ours and grow like we do through their experiences. In his books the main characters have opportunities to grow in strength, power, and character by committing themselves to certain ideals.
        <br>
        <br>
        The characters in the book, "The Way of Kings" have inspired me. Here are two quotes to illustrate.
        <br>
        <br>
        "Somebody has to start. Somebody has to step forward and do what is right, because it is right.”
        <br>
        <br>
        “Sometimes the prize is not worth the costs. The means by which we achieve victory are as important as the victory itself.”

      <h3>Jeff Wheeler</h3>
      <p>
       Jeff Wheeler is the most recent author I have discovered whose words inspire me. On his home page he talks about why he writes the way he does. He expalins, 
       <br>
       <br>
       "In the world I live in, there are plenty of harsh realities. But when I want to enjoy a movie or delve into a book, I want to be inspired. I want to see someone rise to the challenges instead of submit to them. I want to see more Virtus. It is about trying to be someone bigger than yourself, despite the odds, falling down, getting scuffed up, and still going. Even when the one you love goes another way. Even when you fail sometimes. And that is why I write."
       <br>
       <br>
       This philosophy comes through in his writings and stories. His characters are not perfect people, but they are people or strong moral character who don't give up when most others would, they always defend what is right and true even at great personal cost to themselves.
